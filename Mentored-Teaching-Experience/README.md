# Mentored Teaching Experience (PhD Milestone)

## Quant Methods II (Instructor: Shelly Cooper, PhD)
Materials for an 80-minute lecture on resampling methods for psychological research. Wide range of resampling methods were introduced (e.g., jackknife resampling, bootstrapping, and permutation testing). The session was led using the R programming language, and the materials were adapted from the materials provided by the course instructor. 

* Quantitative Methods II was the second part of a two-semester course that all incoming graduate students in the psychology department had to take in their first year. To read more about the course, look for PSYCH 5067 in the following [link](https://psych.wustl.edu/course_listing).

## Text-as-Data (Instructor: Brandon Stewart, PhD)
Materials for a two-hour lab session on measurement and classification (Naive Bayes Classifiers, Lasso Regression, and Dense Neural Nets for text classification). The session was led using the R programming language using the packages *quanteda*, *glmnet*, *tensorflow*, *kaggle*, *tidymodels*, and *textrecipes* packages. The materials were adapted from materials provided by the course instructor. 

* Text-as-Data was a Summer short-course hosted by the Political Science department at WashU and TRIADS (Transdisciplinary Institute in Applied Data Sciences) as part of the School of Arts & Sciences Strategic Plan. The course was offered to graduate students at WashU for two weeks.
