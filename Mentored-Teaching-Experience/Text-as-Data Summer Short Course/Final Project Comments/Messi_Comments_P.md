+ To my understanding, you are looking at each justice's personal definition on an issue from Dissents and comparing them to that of the unanimous rulings to see which of these are more proximate to that of the unanimous ruling. And from that, you are trying to understand who has the greatest influence in the majority opinion. This is a really interesting approach, and I really liked reading the proposal.

+ I don't have outstanding comments on the proposed analysis. Seems pretty straightforward, and I buy the rationale that "... the justice with the highest cosine similarity to the opinion would be the most influential justice in the opinion's formulation." although I am unfamiliar with judicial decision-making. 

+ Also agree with the possible issue mentioned, but it doesn't seem like a reach to assume that they act somewhat consistently in the Supreme Court and in lower court. 

+ Sounds like a cool project. Good luck!
