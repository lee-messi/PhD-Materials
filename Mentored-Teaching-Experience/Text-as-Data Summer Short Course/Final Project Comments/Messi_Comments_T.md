+ The abstract was absolutely attention-grabbing. Really enjoyed reading the proposal!

+ I had a question about a very specific wording in you interpretation of results (and mind my ignorance if I am totally off-board on this): You write that, "Contrary to the widespread belief that authoritarian regimes primarily aim to discredit the West through their propaganda and censorship appartus, my findings suggest a more *nuanced* approach. They indicate that these regimes express greater concern about public exposure to democratic institutions rather than the achievements of democracies." Looking at these results, I am given the impression that the regime is censoring articles regardless of the sentiment or the substance of the article, and I wonder if *nuanced* would be the right expression to charaterize their censorship apparatus. It almost feels the opposite of *nuanced*. 

+ I find the existing problems section of the draft really helpful. It also seems to explain why the confidence intervals in the plot for positive posts are much smaller than that of the negative posts (the im-balance of positive and negative coverage seems to be causing that). 

+ I am unsure if the proposed solution for the imbalance, which is to add an additional layer of fine-tuning, would solve this issue. Given that you are already using a fine-tuned model for sentiment analysis, it may just be that the posts are generally more positive than negative. Articles tend to be of positive sentiment, right? 

+ Interesting project, especially given my (past) interest in censorship and Authoritarian regimes. Look forward to learning more about the project!
