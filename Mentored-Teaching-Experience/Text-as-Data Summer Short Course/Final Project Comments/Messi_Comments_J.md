+ Really enjoyed reading this proposal. As someone not well-versed in American politics, I found it as a great way to learn about Earmarks for the very first time. 

+ If I am understanding correctly, you are planning to induce ALC embeddings for words that could refer to Earmarks (e.g., "pork" and "pork-barrel") for *always earmarkers*, *never earmarkers*, and *sometimes earmarkers*. What is unclear to me here is **how** you are planning to perform the sentiement analysis. I am assuming that you are planning to define a set of words to represent positive and negative sentiment and compare cosine similarity measurements between the ALC embeddings and these sentiment words. Is that right? 

+ I find using structural topic models to delve deeper into the kind of requests made by different Republicans to be interesting. Would really like to know what you find there. 

+ Overall, I see that you are leveraging a wide variety of methods that were introduced in the workshop and see that you are using them appropriately. 

+ A short question: What are your hypotheses for some, if not all, of the analyses that you propose here?
