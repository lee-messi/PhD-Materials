+ Wow. Fascinating project. Had to read a couple of times to understand the topic and the performed analyses, but I really enjoyed reading this. 

+ I agree that "... the appearance or subsidence of particular (letter) trigrams might well be driven more by vocabulary than by spelling." Some words come and go, and that could have led to certain tri-grams being more or less prevalent at different time periods. I like how the argument and the proposal are put into context. 

+ I am deferring comments on the proposed analysis to Brandon, but the idea of finding plausible instances of archacic spelling reminds of diachronic word embeddings that Hamilton et al., (2016) proposed in [their paper](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/diachronic-acl16.pdf) to study laws of semantic change. This, somewhat related to ALC embeddings, is a model trained on the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), a corpus of 200 years, that induces word representations for every decade. Here, we would expect subsided words (or words that changed in spelling) to have experienced a significant semantic shift given their relative infrequency in the corpus. 

+ Unfortunately, I struggled to make the direct connection between diachronic word embeddings and the research question central to the proposed project. But, I am hoping that it can serve as a food for thought.
