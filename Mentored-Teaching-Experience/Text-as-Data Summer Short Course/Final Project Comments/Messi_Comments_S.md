+ This is so cool. Doing research in social psychology and (a little bit in) political science, this topic really stood out to me, and even without any prior understanding of the topic, I really enjoyed reading the proposal. 

+ What stands out to me as potentially concerning is the sample size. I can imagine sample size being an inherent issue with historical text analyses, but you can imagine a scenario where a ship captain or a specific traveler is just more invested in spice trade than another author of a text in a different time point. I am unsure if such sparse text documents over time would provide a robust measure of topic change. 

+ I see that you mention using unsupervised topic models to assess the frequency and distribution of topics and their co-occurrence(s). This seems like an appropriate analysis for the first set of hypotheses. It would also help to know what your analysis plans are for the second set of analyses: the sentiment analysis. Do you have ideas for what analyses you would like to conduct for those? 

+ Also, I had a hard time comprehending the validation part where you write, "In the process of validating models I will look for classifications along political, economic, and social categories and assess topics that are co-occuring in multiple categories." Can you elaborate more on what this means? 

+ The data set stands out as intriguing. Does the data set contain information on changes to personnel and relationships as you mention in the final sentence?
